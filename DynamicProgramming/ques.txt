DP - Dynamic Programming
- Entirely based on recursion

Overlapping Sub-problem
Sub-structure property

When do we use DP ?
- Count Something, number of ways
- Minimise or Maxmise the values
- Yes/No Questions

DP offers two solutions
- Memoization (Top Down) - maintain one cache
- Tabulation (Bottom Up) - use loop instead of recursion
